 Not actually pool, I guess? Just started to write some custom pool and name sticks now.
 Not sure what is proper name.

/** 
 Guess it's Erlang's simple one for one.
 Ok, why we need a manager on top of room pools? `Room` actors are dynamically created, but in order to distribute actors
 on different nodesâ€”we need somehow know about those nodes. Every room node (see `Server.swift` and `RoomNode.swift`)
 creates a RoomPool and RoomPoolManager listens for them. And then you can get a room pool (round roubin or some order?)
 and spawn room there -> meaning spawning a room on different node.
 Actually still note sure about naming. **Check other frameworks and platforms on how it's managed there**.
